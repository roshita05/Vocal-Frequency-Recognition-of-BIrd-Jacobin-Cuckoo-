This project focused on the vocal frequency analysis of the Jacobin Cuckoo (Clamator jacobinus) using bioacoustic techniques, specifically spectrogram generation, to evaluate changes in vocal patterns over the years. By analyzing acoustic features such as peak frequency, bandwidth, and call duration, the study aimed to understand trends and variations in the birdâ€™s vocal behavior.
Key findings include a noticeable decline in peak frequencies and a narrowing of bandwidths in recent years compared to older recordings. These changes suggest potential shifts in the bird's vocal performance, possibly influenced by biological or physiological factors. Interestingly, the duration of calls remained consistent across all years, indicating the temporal stability of the bird's vocalizations despite other variations.
The project highlights the utility of spectrograms in visualizing and analyzing complex vocal patterns, providing critical insights into the vocal behavior of the Jacobin Cuckoo. These findings lay the groundwork for future bioacoustic studies and contribute to a deeper understanding of avian vocal communication. The methodologies and results presented here can be extended to other species to further explore trends in vocal behavior and their underlying causes.
